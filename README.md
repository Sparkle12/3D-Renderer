# 3D-Renderer (Work in progress)
- OOP based 3D renderer made in C++ using SFML and Linear Algebra.
- Every 3D object can be defined as a series of triangles. To be able to draw it to the screen (a 2D space) I use a projection matrix that transfroms the 3D vector to a 2D one that gives the illusion of 3D.
- The Renderer also supports rotations around all 3 axis.

## Future Plans
- I want to add the ability to change the colors of the objects and to able to create a scene.
- Another goal would be to add camera movement to be able explore the scene.
